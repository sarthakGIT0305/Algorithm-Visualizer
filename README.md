# Algorithm-Visualizer
Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web app that visually demonstrates classic computer science algorithms — including sorting, graph traversal, and tree operations — through animated, real-time simulations. Built with React, it lets users explore the inner workings of these algorithms step by step with customizable inputs and speeds.
